Tested systems:

NVIDIA OpenCl on Jon's office PC. 
    Builds with msvc 9 as delivered by NVIDIA.
    Can use mingw with an import library (added in builds\OpenCL.def).
    Make the library with dlltool -l libopencl.a -d OpenCL.def -k -A
    This will arrive with future mingw compilers it seems


ESRF GPU cluster:
     centos5 has compiler gcc4.1
     log into rnice machines
     $     oarsub -I -p "gpu='YES'"
     Here you can find CL/OpenCL.h in 
	  OCLINC=/usr/local/cuda-3.2.16/include
     Also libOpenCL.so in /usr/lib64
     Works OK with both gcc and icc, but icc was fussy
     Needs a flag to say -no-gcc to prevent it icking a header
     Also cant use the -fast option as it wants a static libOpenCL.so
