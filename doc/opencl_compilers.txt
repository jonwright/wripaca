Tested systems:

NVIDIA OpenCl on Jon's office PC. 
    Builds with msvc 9 as delivered by NVIDIA.
    Can use mingw with an import library (added in builds\OpenCL.def).
    Make the library with dlltool -l libopencl.a -d OpenCL.def -k -A
    This will arrive with future mingw compilers it seems


oarsub -I -p "gpu='YES'"
