WriPaP: Wright's Parallel Pixel Programs
========================================


Jon Wright 2011.

Does parallel computations on 2D images of pixels.
Most of the ideas are taken from other peoples software
packages, books, papers etc. 


Source code layout:
===================
  README    : This file

  include/      Header file giving the public API for C users
    wripaca.h 

  src/          Implementation file including private things in C 
    wripaca.c : 

  swig/         Interfaces for scripting languages (eg python)
    wripaca.i   Swig interface definition
    Makefile    Generate the various interfaces
    python/
        setup.py

  build/        Directory where everything is compiled to make exe
    Makefile
    platform_name/
        make.inc


Build system:
=============

We identify the basic source code files which do not depend 
on the compiler or architecture.
Then there are a series of targets which do depend on the 
compiler and architecture.
Also recipes to get from one to the other.

We would like to build the code for multiple platforms.
Test it to see if it is running OK.
Benchmark it to see what the performance is like.
We expect to use openmp when it is available, also opencl.

The python binding should in independent of *any*  
python library except for ctypes which does the binding (swig??)







Some compiler switches for performance:

Windows MSVC (v9 2008):
 cl.exe /Ox /fp:fast /openmp WriPaP.c

Windows gcc 4.5.1 (TDM 64 bit):
 gcc -ffast-math -fopenmp -O3 -march=native WriPaP.c -o wripap.exe

Windows lcc-win:
 lcc64.exe WriPaP.c
 lcclnk64.exe WriPaP.obj

Linux gcc (3.4.6), NO OPENMP:
 gcc -ffast-math -O3 -lm WriPaP.c -o wripap.exe

Linux gcc (4.1.0):
 gcc4 -fopenmp -ffast-math -O3 WriPaP.c -lm -o wripap 
 
Linux intel icc:
 icc -openmp WriPaP.c -o wripap ; time ./wripap

Linux Portland Group:
 pgcc -mp -O3 WriPaP.c -o wripap ; time OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./wripap



Usage:
    
You need to define your re-binning problem by creating a pair 
of bins entities. These are defined by
